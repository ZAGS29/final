<h3>A little bit about me.</h3>
<p>
  I am an outdoor enthusist and am constantly getting out for hikes or adventures with my dog Bear. I have had three big dogs and am really inclined to their sweetness and companionship. I currently have a labradoodle who is a joy to have and needs a lot of exercise. I have always been into exercising myself and have played five sports growing up. I enjoy being apart of a team and sharing in group achievements. I think the lessons I learned in sports growing up carries over nicely to working with peers. I like to meditate daily to keep myself centered. I have practiced many different meditations and I think my favoite is Vapasana or loving kindness meditation. I enjoy doing art whenever I have the freetime. It has alos been a interest of mine since I was five.
